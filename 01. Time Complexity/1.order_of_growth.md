## Definition:

- Order of growth determines the general behaviour of an algorithm when the input size is large.

## Limitation of order of growth analysis:

- The input might never reach to a large value.<br/>
- For smaller values of n, generally we don't need order of growth analysis.

## Direct way to compare order of growth

- Ignore lower order terms
- Ignore leading constants

## Lower order terms priority :

- constant < log(log(n)) < n<sup>1/3</sup> < n<sup>1/2</sup> < n < n<sup>2</sup> < n<sup>3</sup> < n<sup>4</sup> < 2<sup>n</sup> < n<sup>n</sup>
